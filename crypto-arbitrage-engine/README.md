# Synthetic Pair Deviation Engine

A high-performance cryptocurrency arbitrage trading system written in C++ that detects and exploits price deviations between synthetic pairs and real pairs across multiple exchanges.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Real-time WebSocket connections to OKX, Binance, and Bybit
- **Synthetic Pricing**: Advanced pricing models for futures, perpetuals, and complex derivatives
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Multiple strategies including spot, synthetic, funding, and calendar spreads
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive position limits, VaR calculations, and exposure controls
- **High Performance**: SIMD optimizations, lock-free data structures, and microsecond latency

### Arbitrage Strategies
1. **Spot Arbitrage**: Price differences across exchanges for the same asset
2. **Synthetic Arbitrage**: Mispricing between real and synthetic instruments
3. **Funding Arbitrage**: Exploiting funding rate differences on perpetual swaps
4. **Calendar Spreads**: Futures contract spread mispricings
5. **Statistical Arbitrage**: Mean reversion on synthetic spreads

### Technical Architecture
- **Multi-threaded Design**: Parallel processing for market data and detection
- **Memory Optimization**: Custom allocators and object pooling
- **SIMD Acceleration**: Vectorized calculations for order book operations
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-10ms opportunity detection latency

}
```

## üö¶ Usage

### Starting the Engine
```bash
cd build
./scripts/run.sh
```

### Command Line Options
```bash
./arbitrage_engine [options]
```

### Environment Variables
- `TBB_NUM_THREADS`: Number of TBB worker threads (default: CPU cores)
- `OMP_NUM_THREADS`: OpenMP thread count (default: CPU cores)

## üìä Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
The engine provides comprehensive real-time monitoring:

- **Opportunities**: Detection rate, execution rate, profit distribution
- **System**: CPU usage, memory consumption, network latency
- **Risk**: Portfolio exposure, position limits, VaR calculations
- **Performance**: Processing latency, message throughput

### Logging
Logs are written to `logs/arbitrage_engine.log` with configurable levels:
- `trace`: Detailed debugging information
- `debug`: Development debugging
- `info`: General information (default)
- `warn`: Warning messages
- `error`: Error conditions
